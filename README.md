Python script to convert video files to audio files using ffmpeg

Here I manage my youtube videos and convert them into tagged audio files. 

It is a lot more python code than I wanted. And it is throughly hardcoded to my liking. My paths are hardcoded and artist list too.

DONT BOTHER RUNNING THIS ON YOUR ENV.
